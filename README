futuretools
===========

With the introduction of concurrent.futures, python has provided a standard way
to express concurrency in programs. The built-in ThreadPoolExecutor and
ProcessPoolExecutor each have their limitations, but they already provide
substantial opportunities for parallelism. More importantly, an algorithm that
uses the concurrent.futures interface can be agnostic about the nature of the
pool. This package is a collection of numerical code that uses
concurrent.futures to express concurrency, and Executor implementations to allow
these algorithms to use other kinds of parallelism, for example, MPI or the
ipython parallel interface (which can run on top of MPI).
